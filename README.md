# Music‑Acoustic

**Investigating how different string materials affect sound characteristics**

A simple project exploring how materials like Gut, Nylgut, Nylon, Steel, Flatwound, Roundwound, and Silk influence guitar string timbre, decay, and overall acoustic profile.

## Overview

This project compares acoustic traits of various string materials. It examines how each material shapes the sound’s tone, sustain, and perceived warmth or brightness.

---

## Approach

- Recorded plucks of each string type at different playing intensities in a controlled lab setup.
- Analyzed recordings using both Python and MATLAB scripts to visualize sound decay, spectral content, and harmonic behavior.

---

## Key Findings

- **Flatwound**: produces a smooth, mellow tone with less high-frequency emphasis.  
- **Roundwound & Steel**: sound brighter and richer in high-frequency harmonics.  
- **Gut and Nylgut**: offer warmer and softer timbres, with behavior closer to traditional gut strings.  
- **Inharmonicity**: materials like steel have more noticeable inharmonic overtones, whereas gut, flatwound, and Nylgut show smoother harmonic profiles.

---

## Discussion

- Human plucking introduces variability; lab environment and tuning precision may affect results.  
- Future steps: include half-wound strings, use different playing techniques, and test on actual instruments with resonant bodies.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LawLv/Music-Acoustic.git
   cd Music-Acoustic
2. Explore available scripts (.py and .m) and audio files (.wav), then run them to recreate or visualize the analyses.
